                <p>Once the framework for “Performance Management” has been set, it is important to underpin it with an appropriate Reward System to drive superior performance.

                <p>When organizations and businesses clearly define and articulate their vision and strategies, the potential obstacles to the achievement of the strategies are the “way they are set up to work” and “how they actually work”. In many instances, the processes and systems in an organization address internal convenience and resolve short-term control issues.  The effect is complexity and cost from ineffectively structured and/or conflicting systems and processes that do not add value to the business or its customers.</p>

                    <p class="item-list">Research shows that teams go through a cycle of forming, storming, norming and performing. Companies need to understand and respond to these cycles. Apart from the “hard” targets like turnover, profit, productivity and so on teams also bond into high performing teams on “soft” issues such as honesty, transparency, trust and support for each other. Effective teams have been identified as a core factor to organizational success.</p>
